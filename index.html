                As it's thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it's also believed it made its way north, across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown here in the Yemeni district of Arabia, and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.

                Our journey from bean to cup started in year 2000. Café culture had not set its footprint and coffee was still considered a luxury.
                Our quest to provide a true coffee experience and brew a perfect cup led us to create the brand Barista. Spearheading the Indian café culture, 
                Barista is an opportunity to discover both the coffee and the craft.
                <br><br>
                Today, as we continue to brew your favorite coffee and take time to enhance customer experience, we have created coffee relationship with our 
                patrons in 450+ cafes and over 147+ cities.
